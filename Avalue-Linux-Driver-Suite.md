# Avalue Linux Driver Suite

**Version:** 4.0.0

**Manufacturer:** Avalue Technology Co., Ltd.

## Overview

This repository contains the Linux kernel drivers for Avalue industrial motherboards and embedded systems.

It provides onboard features including:

* [Watch dog](WDT)
* [GPIO](GPIO)
* [Hardware Monitor](HWM)
* [Misc](MISC)

---

## Prerequisites

Before building the drivers, ensure your system has the necessary build tools and kernel headers installed.

### Debian/Ubuntu

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install build-essential linux-headers-$(uname -r)
```

### RHEL/CentOS/Fedora

```bash
sudo yum install make gcc kernel-devel-$(uname -r)
```

`kernel-devel` (or `linux-headers` on Debian/Ubuntu) must match the kernel you
are **running**, not just installed -- check with `uname -r` first. A mismatch
here is the most common first failure, and it looks like a driver problem when
it is not one.

---

## Supported kernels

The oldest kernel driver 4.0 is known to build on is **4.15** (one subsystem
at a time -- see below); the oldest on which a plain `make` builds everything
in one run is **5.4.302**. The newest is **6.14.0**. A kernel version number
is not always what it looks like: enterprise
distributions (RHEL, AlmaLinux, Rocky, SLES) backport years of newer kernel code
under an older-looking version string, so a matching number is not by itself a
guarantee.

Kernel versions older than 4.15 are unsupported. On a working 4.15 tree the
subsystems build, one at a time (`make watchdog`, `make gpio`, `make hwmon`,
`make misc`) -- the table below is that measurement, not a claim. A plain
`make`, which builds every enabled subsystem in one run, fails on 4.15 for a
reason in that kernel's own build system. On 4.15, build one subsystem at a
time.

On 4.15 the hwmon module registers through plain sysfs attribute groups,
because 4.15's headers do not carry the newer chip_info API. Its sensor files
appear in `in/`, `temp/`, `fan/` and `pwm/` subdirectories under
`/sys/class/hwmon/hwmonN/`, not as the flat `inN_input` files that kernel 5.4
and newer get, so a tool expecting the standard layout (`sensors`) will not
find them there. This path was built and linked against a real 4.15 tree with
its own `Module.symvers` (the `4.15.0-101` rows below), and modpost resolved
every symbol the module imports -- but it has not been run on 4.15 hardware.

One row per kernel line we have actually built against, except the two
`4.15.0-101` rows: that tree is graded per board, because the two boards
declare a different set of subsystems and the grading counts them (see the
Note column). A line not in this table is simply untested, not unsupported.

| Distribution | Kernel version | Build status | Note |
|---|---|---|---|
| Ubuntu (mainline-style) | 4.15.18 | Does not build | Our build host's tree for this line stops before the compiler runs: a plain `make` ends at `No rule to make target '.../src/hal/ec/ite.o'` with zero `CC [M]` lines. That tree is also missing `scripts/mod/modpost` and `tools/objtool/objtool`, which the six other `/kernels` trees in this table have -- but the build stops earlier than either of those is needed, so this is our tree being incomplete, not the 4.15 kernel line. On a good 4.15 tree the driver does build, one subsystem at a time (see the two rows below). |
| Ubuntu (fetched `linux-headers` package, not under `/kernels`) | 4.15.0-101 -- EPC-WHL | Builds clean | A real, complete 4.15 tree ([recipe](Test-infrastructure)), built one subsystem at a time: this board declares watchdog, gpio and hwmon (no misc). All 3 produced a `.ko`, `make` exited 0 for each, and every `.ko`'s `modinfo -F vermagic` reads `4.15.0-101-generic SMP mod_unload`. |
| Ubuntu (fetched `linux-headers` package, not under `/kernels`) | 4.15.0-101 -- ESM-KX60G | Builds clean | Same tree and method as the row above; this board declares all four subsystems. All 4 produced a `.ko`, `make` exited 0 for each, same `vermagic`. |
| Ubuntu (mainline-style) | 5.4.302 | Builds clean | |
| Ubuntu (mainline-style) | 5.15.211 | Builds clean | Needs the `-Wno-error=type-limits` line already in `Kbuild` (the kernel's own `bits.h` GENMASK trips this warning) |
| Ubuntu (mainline-style) | 6.6.89 | Builds clean | |
| Ubuntu (mainline-style) | 6.8.2 | Builds clean | |
| Ubuntu (mainline-style) | 6.12.27 | Builds clean | |
| Ubuntu (mainline-style) | 6.14.0 | Builds clean | |
| AlmaLinux 9.8 (EL9) | 5.14.0-687.29.1.el9\_8 | Builds clean | Real `kernel-devel` tree, not a vanilla kernel.org 5.14 |

"Builds clean" above means a plain `make` -- no subsystem named, so it builds
every subsystem the board's `.conf` declares in one run -- for every row
except the two `4.15.0-101` ones. Kernel 4.15's own build system rejects a
bare `make` (see the paragraph above), so those two rows come from the
per-subsystem targets (`make watchdog`, `make gpio`, `make hwmon`,
`make misc`) instead. The `4.15.18` row is still a plain `make`; it is the one
that fails before the compiler runs, on our own incomplete host tree.

Seven of the ten rows are the prepared trees under `/kernels`, and two are a
tree fetched into `/kernels-cache` -- `test/build-matrix.sh` builds both
sources (see the script's own header comment, and
[test/Test-infrastructure.md](Test-infrastructure) for how the `/kernels-cache` tree was
prepared). The AlmaLinux 9.8 row is the only one still built by hand: it is a
`kernel-devel` package, not a tree under either directory, so
`test/build-matrix.sh` never builds it -- its row comes from the same plain
`make`, run by hand against the extracted `kernel-devel` tree.

`test/build-matrix.sh` treats every row above except the AlmaLinux one as a
claim it must measure: a run that never produces that row -- the tree is
missing, not prepared, or (for the two `4.15.0-101` rows) `$KERNELS_CACHE_DIR`
itself is absent -- fails the run instead of skipping it quietly.
`EXCLUDE_KERNELS` is the per-run way to acknowledge a known gap; name a
kernel there and its absence, like its failure, no longer fails the run.

A `/kernels` row is graded on the build output, not on the exit code: at
least one `CC [M]` line and no lowercase `error:` line. That distinction
matters on the 6.x rows. None of the trees under `/kernels` carries a
`Module.symvers`, so modpost there cannot resolve the kernel symbols an
out-of-tree module imports. Six of the seven `/kernels` rows reach that
stage, and what differs between them is how each kernel's own modpost
answers it:
on all four 6.x trees it fails the build (`ERROR: modpost: "..." undefined!`,
exit 2, and it prints `You can set KBUILD_MODPOST_WARN=1 to turn errors into
warning`), while on 5.15 the same unresolved symbols come out as `WARNING:`
lines and `make` exits 0, and on 5.4 modpost does not report them at all. So a
6.x row can exit 2 with every object compiled cleanly, and the 5.4 and 5.15
rows need no allowance. The AlmaLinux row needs none either, for a different
reason: a `kernel-devel` tree ships its own `Module.symvers`, so there modpost
resolved every symbol and the modules linked completely.

The two `4.15.0-101` rows are graded a second, different way: that tree's
Kbuild prints zero `CC [M]` lines even on a build that fully succeeds, so
counting compiler lines cannot grade it. Instead every subsystem the board
declares must produce its `.ko`, and every `make` must exit with no `error:`
line. The Build status column above still reads "Builds clean" / "Does not
build"; the raw table that `test/build-matrix.sh` prints shows this as a
produced-of-expected count (`3/3`, `4/4`) in its own `CC-LINES` column, so a
reader of the script's own output sees which rule graded a given row.

The `4.15.18` row is outside all of that: on our build host that tree stops
before the compiler runs, so its build prints no `CC [M]` line and never
reaches modpost at all. Its row reads "Does not build" for that reason, not
because of an unresolved symbol. `test/build-matrix.sh` carries this tree as
a committed exception in `EXPECTED_FAIL_KERNELS`: its own report grades the
row `FAIL (expected)`, and a run that finds it broken here still exits 0. If
this tree ever starts building clean, the run exits 1 and names it, because
that would mean `EXPECTED_FAIL_KERNELS` and this row are both now wrong.

Build status is measured on the two boards `test/build-matrix.sh` builds
(`EPC-WHL`, `ESM-KX60G`), not on every board this driver supports.

## Board Configuration

The build system dynamically selects the target board configuration. It prioritizes the configuration in the following order:

1. **Command Line Argument:** `BOARD_NAME=xxx` passed to `make`.
2. **Auto-Detection:** Reads `/sys/class/dmi/id/board_name` from the host system.

Configuration files are located in `configs/boards/`.

### Checking Your Board Name

To see what board name the system detects:

```bash
cat /sys/class/dmi/id/board_name
```

---

## Building the Drivers

### 1. Standard Build (Auto-Detect)

If you are compiling natively on the target Avalue board:

```bash
make
```

*This will auto-detect the board name and build all enabled modules defined in the `.conf` file.*

### 2. Manual Selection

If you are building for a different board or the auto-detection is incorrect:

```bash
make BOARD_NAME=ECM-APL
```

### 3. Building Specific Modules

You can force the build of specific modules, overriding the board configuration defaults:

* **Watchdog:**
```bash
make watchdog
```


* **GPIO:**
```bash
make gpio
```


* **Hardware Monitor:**
```bash
make hwmon
```

### 4. Debug Mode

To build the Watchdog driver with debug symbols and extra logging enabled:

* **Watchdog:**
```bash
make watchdog-debug
```

* **GPIO:**
```bash
make gpio-debug
```

* **Hardware Monitor:**
```bash
make hwmon-debug
```

### 5. Multi-kernel Build Check

`test/build-matrix.sh` builds the driver against every prepared kernel tree it
finds, for `EPC-WHL` (watchdog + hwmon + gpio) and `ESM-KX60G` (all four
subsystems), and prints a pass/fail table. It needs kernel trees available on
disk (default `/kernels`, override with the `KERNELS_DIR` environment
variable).

```bash
bash test/build-matrix.sh
```

This exits **0** on a correctly prepared host. The `linux-4.15.18` row reads
`FAIL (expected)` -- a committed, known exception (see "Supported kernels"
above) -- and does not fail the run; every other required row must build
clean.

Those two boards exercise every subsystem, but they both use the same ITE /
pca9555 / i801 HALs, so a chip family neither one selects never gets
compiled. The script also runs a second pass that builds one board per
distinct HAL "shape" -- the exact set of `src/hal/` files a board's `.conf`
selects, derived at runtime from `configs/boards/*.conf` -- on `$COVERAGE_KERNEL`
(default `linux-5.4.302`), so every HAL file any board can reach gets
compiled at least once. A HAL `.c` file that no build in the run reaches
fails it.

---

## Installation

The installation process copies the driver modules to a board-specific directory (e.g., `/lib/modules/.../extra/$(BOARD_NAME)/`) and configures the system to load them automatically at boot.

```bash
sudo make install
```

**Note:** If you only built specific modules (e.g., `make watchdog`), `make install` will detect this and **only install the compiled modules**. It will not install uncompiled drivers.

---

## Uninstallation

To remove the installed drivers from the system:

```bash
sudo make uninstall
```

This command will:

1. Stop and unload active modules from kernel memory.
2. Remove the driver files from `/lib/modules/$(uname -r)/extra/$(BOARD_NAME)/`.
3. Remove the auto-load configuration from `/etc/modules-load.d/`.
4. Update the module dependency map (`depmod`).
